# SaaS-Test2

This repository contains a small React application created with Vite. The app showcases a simple product catalog page with no additional styling frameworks.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev --workspace=my-app
   ```


The product catalog is located in `my-app/src/ProductCatalog.jsx` and is rendered inside the main `App` component.
